I know what you want girl
Let me be the one to
Hold your- hold your e-e-ever-
We-we could toge-ge-ge-
I know what you want girl
Let me be the one to
Hold your hand forever
We'd be good together
I’ll make you feel special
Help you feel less stressful
Fix the holes in your heart
It's what I wanted
from the start
I got mental issues
Always fucking miss you
Tons of bloody tissues
All of over my room
I need to clean them up
Baby I'm fucked up
Baby will you help me
Because I’m gonna help you
All I want is you now
All I wanna do now
Is wait for you to call me
Baby I'm so sorry
Do you wanna hurt me
Are you gonna hurt me
Please don't desert me
Please don't desert me
All I want is you now
All I wanna do now
Is wait for you to call me
Baby I'm so sorry
Do you wanna hurt me
Are you gonna hurt me
Please don't desert me
Please don't desert me
Please don't desert me
I was up early
Up all night
I was scratching off the 30s
You make me feel dirty
Tell me I’m disgusting
Tell me that you love me
But really you mean nothing
I don’t wanna talk
No it's not up for discussion
You control my life
I feel like a fucking puppet
Keep telling me to shut it
Ok baby alright
I remember nights
We were dancing in the moonlight
I remember hiding
I was shy and I had stage fright
I remember crying
I just want you to be alright
Want you to be okay
Okay baby alright
Want you to be okay
Okay baby alright
All I want is you now
All I wanna do now
Is wait for you to call me
Baby I’m so sorry
Do you wanna hurt me
Are you gonna hurt me
Please don't desert me
Please don't desert me
All I want is you now
All I wanna do now
Is wait for you to call me
Baby I'm so sorry
Do you wanna hurt me
Are you gonna hurt me
Please don’t desert me
Please don't desert me
